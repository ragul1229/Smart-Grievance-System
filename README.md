Smart Public Grievance Redressal and Monitoring System (MERN Stack)

The Smart Public Grievance Redressal and Monitoring System is a web-based application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to address the real-world issue of lack of transparency, accountability, and efficiency in traditional public grievance handling mechanisms.

The system provides a structured, end-to-end grievance workflow that allows citizens to submit complaints digitally and track their progress in real time. It is designed with three distinct roles:

Citizen – Can submit grievances, attach supporting evidence, track status updates, and provide feedback after resolution.

Department Officer – Views assigned grievances, updates status, adds resolution notes, and communicates with citizens.

Admin – Monitors all grievances across departments, assigns complaints, oversees resolution timelines, and ensures accountability.

The application emphasizes process clarity rather than full production scale, making it suitable as a working prototype. To enhance efficiency, the system integrates light AI features such as basic grievance classification or priority tagging, helping route complaints effectively and highlight urgent cases.

Key features include:

Role-based authentication and access control

Real-time grievance status tracking

Dashboard-based monitoring for all user roles

Feedback and closure mechanism for citizens

Clean, intuitive UI designed for government-style portals

Overall, this project demonstrates how modern web technologies and basic AI assistance can be used to digitize grievance redressal, improve transparency, reduce resolution delays, and enhance trust between citizens and public authorities.
